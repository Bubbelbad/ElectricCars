# ElectricCars

(This program is not entirely done yet, but it runs!)

The purpose of this application was to create an app with 5 design patterns and two sorting algorithms. I chose to make a fictive database that contains data for electric vehicles. The program displays a list of car proxies and the user is able to sort the proxies by brand or price, using two sorting algorithms. 

The user can then click on a specific proxy and it opens a window and retrieves the full car object with all the information about the chosen car. 
The user can also add new cars to the program using the Builder pattern. 


I chose the following patterns and algorithms for the project: 

- Singleton pattern (for database)
- Command pattern (to execute logic)
- Proxy pattern (to display car proxies)
- Builder pattern (for building car object)
- MVVM pattern (WPF structuring)
- Insertion sort & bubble sort (sorting algorithms)







## Lessons Learned

The MVVM pattern was completely new to me. In the beginning it was hard to understand how to structure the classes. Especially how to use bindings to trigger the desired functions in views from the viewmodels with parameters. 

I'm though very pleased with MVVM and it has been SO MUCH FUN to program this and finally understanding MVVM and design patterns a bit more. I think the command pattern was one of the hardest nuts to crack and I'll definetely need more practise.
